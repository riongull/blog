Will the "Create a Draft Article" H1 show up as unstyled when converted and saved to GitHub?

- It looks like H1s  (and maybe other block types) are supported by MediumDraft and the Convert libraries, even though they are not shown in the toolbar.
    - FYI, I changed it back to an H3 in this edit.

What about the "Submit your Draft..." that I changed from H1 to H3?

- Yes, clearly it did.  What did I expect?
